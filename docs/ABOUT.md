Running Unprompted v$VERSION via the official Automatic1111 WebUI extension.

Unprompted is a powerful templating language written in Python.

Unlike most templating languages, Unprompted was designed for **maximum readibility with natural language.** It is built around `[shortcodes]` and inspired by the likes of BBCode.

You can use Unprompted as a standalone library (e.g. `unprompted_dry.py`) or as an extension for [AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui). The extension allows you to create expressive, re-usable prompt templates that are both versatile and easy on the eyes.
